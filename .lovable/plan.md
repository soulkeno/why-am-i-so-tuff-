# keno.lol — Personal Tools Website

## Design Direction
- **Dark theme** with **purple accent gradients** inspired by the reference images
- Minimalistic, professional layout modeled after anticheat.ac
- Interactive animated background (subtle particle/grid effect)
- Cards with **3D tilt effect** on hover and a **purple glow that follows the cursor**
- Clean, slightly rounded buttons (not overly rounded) with smooth hover animations
- Consistent dark card UI with subtle borders

## Pages

### 1. Landing / Home Page
- **Navbar**: Logo "keno.lol" on the left, nav links (Tools, maybe Discord) on the right — clean and minimal
- **Hero Section**: Large bold heading like "keno.lol" with a highlighted purple word (e.g., "Tools"), a short tagline underneath, and a CTA button to scroll to tools
- **Tools Grid**: Two tool cards displayed in a grid, each with:
  - Icon, title, and short description
  - Hover tilt effect + cursor-following glow
  - Click navigates to the tool's dedicated page

### 2. MCTiers Sniper Tool Page
- Layout inspired by the second reference image (MCTiers Queue Sniper screenshot)
- **Hero**: Bold title "MCTiers Queue Sniper" with purple gradient text
- **Introduction Card**: Explains what the tool does
- **Setup Tutorial Card**: Numbered step-by-step instructions (open Discord, open console with F12/Ctrl+Shift+J, paste code, press enter)
- **Configuration/Code Card**: The JavaScript code displayed in a styled code block with a **copy-to-clipboard button**
- All cards use the dark UI style with tilt + glow effects

### 3. Video Hoster Tool Page
- Similar layout structure as MCTiers page
- **Hero**: Bold title "Video Hoster" with purple gradient text
- **Description Card**: Explains what it does — host videos for free, share via link in Discord
- **CTA Button**: "Go to Video Hoster" that redirects to www.sakn.lol

## Interactions & Animations
- **Card tilt**: 3D perspective tilt effect following mouse position on all cards
- **Cursor glow**: Purple radial gradient glow that follows the cursor over cards
